## About

This will be a personal full-stack project where I intend on making a kanban board/task manager for myself.

### Why

While I use Asana at work, at times I want something a bit more simple, and something I can have more control over. It is also a chance to work on my portfolio of projects and give me an opportunity to learn new things. I believe this is a well-rounded project where I can practice a wide scope of things; database setup, server-side data handling and business logic, front-end design (UI/UX), APIs and testing.

## Technologies

### Languages

- Python
- Javascript
- HTML & CSS

### Frameworks

- Django & Django REST Framework
- React/Next.js
- Tailwind

### Tools/etc

- Figma
- Visual Studio Code
- Database Relationship diagrams
- Sequence diagrams

I am making an effort to try out as many new technologies as possible to broaden my knowledge.

## Progress

- Project/Folder setup ![](https://progress-bar.dev/90)
- Database/models planning ![](https://progress-bar.dev/96)
- Frontend coding ![](https://progress-bar.dev/65)
- Backend coding ![](https://progress-bar.dev/20)

## Design/Planning

### Initial Design in Figma

One of the first things I started off with was the design of the web app. It fleshed out the idea I had in my head, and helped build a foundation off of which I could plan out the frontend, backend and database.

### Sequence Diagrams

In my efforts to document and plan out the flow of parts of the project, I made [sequence diagrams](https://sequencediagram.org/).

### Database Relationship Diagram

Forming the backbone of the project, I used [DBDiagram](https://dbdiagram.io) to plan out all the tables and their relations that I would need.

## Future Features

To make the initial development more manageable and avoid burnout, I moved certain features into later development (hoping I don't decide to put it off forever).

- [ ] Project boards: wouldn't be a kanban board without one.
- [ ] Calendar: to visualise task deadlines and priorities.
- [ ] Notifications: when working in teams it makes updates, new tasks, etc. easier to follow.
