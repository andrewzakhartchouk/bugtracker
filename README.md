## About
This will be a personal full-stack project where I intend on making a kanban board/task manager for myself. 

#### Why
While I use Asana at work, at times I want something a bit more simple, and something I can have more control over. It is also a chance to work on my portfolio of projects and give me an opportunity to learn new thigns. I believe this is a well-rounded project where I can practice a wide scope of things; database setup, server-side data handling and business logic, front-end design (UI/UX), APIs and testing.

## Technologies
#### Languages
- Python
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS

#### Frameworks
- Django
- React
- Tailwind

I am making an effort to try out as many new technologies as possible to broaden my knowledge.
